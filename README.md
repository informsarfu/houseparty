# üè† House Party  
**A real-time file-sharing and collaboration platform built with React and Django REST Framework**

House Party enables multiple users to join shared rooms, upload and view files securely, and collaborate in real time.  
It integrates a JWT-based authentication system for secure access, optimized API interactions, and automated media management.

---

## üöÄ Features

### üîê Authentication & Authorization
- JWT authentication using **Django REST Framework SimpleJWT** with access and refresh tokens.
- Secure logout through token blacklisting to invalidate refresh tokens.
- Protected React routes ensure only authenticated users access the dashboard.

### üíæ File Sharing System
- Create, join, and manage **rooms** via unique room codes.
- Upload multiple files simultaneously with real-time previews for images and PDFs.
- Delete files directly and maintain clean storage with Django model cascading delete logic.

### ‚ö° Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Built an intuitive, responsive interface using **React** and **TypeScript**.
- Managed state efficiently with **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`).
- Reduced API overhead by using **Axios caching** and controlled dependency arrays.
- Modal-based file previews for a clean, user-friendly experience.

### üß† Backend (Django + DRF)
- Designed RESTful APIs with **Django REST Framework**, serializers, and permission classes.
- Room-based file organization with clear relational models between users and uploads.
- Implemented cascading deletion logic to remove media files automatically when rooms are deleted.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Database & Storage
- **PostgreSQL** used for relational data (users, rooms, metadata).
- File uploads handled via Django‚Äôs built-in **File Storage System**.
